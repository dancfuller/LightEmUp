# backend/ — Server internals

FastAPI app. Entry: `main.py` (all endpoints). Device I/O: `discovery.py`. Scene
engine: `scenes.py`. Version: `version.py`. See the root `CLAUDE.md` for workflow
rules (versioning, commits, deploy). **Keep this file current when behavior changes.**

## Config persistence
- `config.json` (gitignored; template `config.json.example`) is read at startup and
  rewritten on every mutation. Use the existing save helper in `main.py` — don't
  hand-roll JSON writes.
- Keys include: bridge creds, room assignments, nicknames, room layouts, scene
  settings, `ct_correction`, `ct_rgb`, per-room color state (incl. `shuffle_seed`,
  `target_vendor`), device modes, segment fill modes.

## Govee LAN (UDP) — two send paths, pick the right one
- Control commands (turn / brightness / colorwc / color_temp) **get no UDP reply.**
  Use `govee_lan_send()` — fire-and-forget, returns immediately.
  - This is the v2.9.3 fix: the old path waited up to 3s on `recvfrom` for a reply
    that never comes, so every color/brightness command blocked the full timeout and
    sliders/calibration were "brutally slow."
- Only `devStatus` replies. `govee_lan_command()` (with the 3s recv wait) is for
  **status queries only.**
- Port 4002 can only be bound by one socket at a time; status queries must be
  sequential, not parallel. `SO_REUSEADDR` + random-port fallback live in `discovery.py`.

## Govee per-segment (cloud_v2 V2 API) — rate-limited, batch it
- Segmented SKUs (hexa `H6061`, globe `H70C1`, rope `H61D3` — all 15 segments) use
  the cloud V2 API, which is rate-limited. One call per segment overran the limit and
  dropped later segments (they stuck on the base color).
- `govee_v2_segments_color(api_key, sku, mac, segments: list, r, g, b)` sets a **list**
  of segment indices to one RGB in a single call (`segmentedColorRgb` accepts a list).
  Endpoint: `POST /api/govee/segments-multi`. The frontend batches segments by color →
  ~6 calls for a white palette instead of ~30 (v2.10.0). Stagger ~1.8s between calls.
- The Razer per-segment protocol is the alternative but auto-reverts after 60s without
  keepalive packets — prefer cloud_v2 for set-and-leave scenes.

## White-temperature calibration (Govee renders CT bluer than Hue)
Two mechanisms; `ct_rgb` takes precedence over legacy `ct_correction`:
- `ct_correction` {in→out Kelvin}: remaps a requested Kelvin to a warmer Kelvin still
  sent as native CT. `correct_kelvin(ip, k)`.
- `ct_rgb` {in, out}: `out` is an *effective* warm Kelvin converted to RGB via
  `kelvin_to_rgb()` and sent as an RGB color — this bypasses Govee's blue CT floor
  (the white LEDs can't go that warm; the RGB LEDs can). `ct_rgb_color(ip, k)` returns
  the RGB tuple (mired-space interpolation of `out`), or `None` if uncalibrated.
- On a CT request, `control_govee` and the segment endpoints resolve `ct_rgb_color(...)`
  first; if present, send RGB; else fall back to corrected native CT. Calibration is
  saved via `POST /api/calibration/ct-rgb`; surfaced in `/api/config` as `ct_rgb`.

## SSE live-sync (multi-session)
- `_event_subscribers` queues; `publish_event(type, **fields)` fans out to all open
  clients via `GET /api/events`. Each event is tagged with the originating client
  (`_current_client_id` ContextVar, set by HTTP middleware from the `X-Client-Id`
  header) so clients ignore their own echoes.
- **When you add a mutating endpoint, call `publish_event("config")`** (or a more
  specific type) so other open sessions refresh.
- SSE streams are long-lived requests that never complete. uvicorn is configured with
  `timeout_graceful_shutdown=5` (and the unit has `TimeoutStopSec=10`) so a restart
  force-closes them instead of hanging (v2.9.4). Don't remove these.
